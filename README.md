## Coding standards

For code analysis we use the [Airbnb style guide for javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and for formatting we use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).

```
# Check for coding standards issues
npm run check-coding-standards

# Auto-correct coding standards issues
npm run apply-coding-standards
```

## Testing with cypress

We use [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for testing.


```
npm run test
```

Or spinning up electron:

```
test-ui
```
